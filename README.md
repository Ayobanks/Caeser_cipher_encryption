# Caesar Cipher in Python

This is my very first Python project, built as part of my internship at Infotech.  
It's a simple Caesar cipher program that can encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters by a key you provide.

## What It Does

- Takes a message input from the user  
- Takes a shift key (number) input  
- Lets the user choose to **encrypt** or **decrypt** the message  
- Keeps uppercase and lowercase letters unchanged  
- Outputs the encrypted or decrypted message

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.  
2. Clone this repository or download the `caesar_cipher.py` file.  
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder with the file.  
4. Run the program with:

   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
